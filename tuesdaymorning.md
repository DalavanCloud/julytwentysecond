This morning, I picked up three bananas for a dollar at a street stand before I got on the subway. By myself, I rode both the 6 and the 4 trains to eventually stop at Bowling Green where The Flatiron School is located. Observing along the way, I took in peoples' choice of wardrobe, iphone app, breakfast fuel and morning expression. It was a beautiful and busling day like any other in the city. I love the energy of the New York. I feel worlds away from Mechanicsburg, PA.
